Initial Setup:

The secret number and a list of secret numbers are generated correctly.
Routes:

welcome: Displays a welcome message.
reset: Generates a new secret number.
number_guessing_game: Handles both GET and POST requests. GET request shows the guess form, and POST request processes the guess, providing feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
guess_secret_numbers: Handles both GET and POST requests. GET request shows the guess form, and POST request checks if the guessed number is in the secret numbers list, providing appropriate feedback.

Testing:
Verified that the application initializes correctly.
Confirmed that the secret number and secret numbers are generated and reset as expected.
Ensured the guess functionality works, providing correct feedback based on the user's input.
Validated the display of secret numbers for debugging purposes.

Edge Cases:
Tested with edge values (1 and 80) to ensure they are handled properly.
Tested with invalid inputs to verify robustness.
